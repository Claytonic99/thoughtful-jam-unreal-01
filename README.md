## How to Clone this repo and start developing in Unreal Engine 5.3.2

- The first step is to follow this guide if you do not have git + git LFS installed -> [Git LFS Installation](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/working-with-files/managing-large-files/installing-git-large-file-storage?source=post_page-----1854d6337177--------------------------------)

- Clone the repository using the following command:

```git clone https://github.com/JPTomorrow/thoughtful-jam-unreal-01```

- Open Unreal Engine 5.3.2. Search for the project at the directory you cloned it and add it as a project in the UE5 launcher.
  
- Should be good to go!

## How to contribute with a Pull Request (Ask if you don't know how to use Git and I'll help you out)
 
** BEFORE YOU GET TO WORKING ON A CONTRIBUTION, MAKE SURE YOU HAVE THE LATEST VERSION OF THE MASTER BRANCH PULLED LOCALLY ON YOUR PC EVERY MORNING, THIS WILL SAVE A LOT OF HEADACHE WHEN YOU GO TO MAKE YOUR PULL REQUEST **

1. Make a new branch using whatever git client you are comfortable using.
2. Make your changes.
3. Commit your changes.
4. Push your changes to your branch.
5. Create a pull request for your branch on Github.
6. Wait for the pull request to be reviewed by me and merged into master branch.

- When you are working on a new feature, be careful not to change any files or assets that don't pertain to the feature you are working on. This will make it easier to merge your changes into the master branch. If you change an asset someone else is working on, it will be difficult to merge as we will have to resolve conflicts for that file. If you don't know what this means, get in touch with me and I'll explain it to you.
